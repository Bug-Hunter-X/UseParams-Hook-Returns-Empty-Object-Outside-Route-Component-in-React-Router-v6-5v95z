In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook within a component that's *not* directly nested within a route's `Route` element can lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, the `params` object returned by `useParams` will always be empty, even if the URL matches a route pattern. This is because `useParams` relies on the router's context to determine the current route parameters. If the component is not within the route hierarchy, it doesn't have access to this context.
